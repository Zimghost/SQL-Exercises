It seems there are a few people living in these villages. How can I see a list of all inhabitants?

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT

Thank you, Edward! Okay, let's see who is friendly on this island...

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE state = 'friendly'

There is no way around getting a sword for myself. I will now try to find a friendly weaponsmith to forge me one. 
(Hint: You can combine predicates in the WHERE clause with AND)

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE state = 'friendly' and job = 'weaponsmith'

Oh, that does not look good. Maybe other friendly smiths can help you out, e.g. a blacksmith. 
Try out: job LIKE '%smith' to find all inhabitants whose job ends with 'smith' 
(% is a wildcard for any number of characters).

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE state = 'friendly' and job LIKE '%smith'

No need to call me stranger! What's my personid? 
(Hint: In former queries, the * stands for: all columns. Instead of the star, you can also address one or more columns 
(seperated by a comma) and you will only get the columns you need.)

SELECT personid
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE name = 'Stranger'

I can offer to make you a sword for 150 gold. That's the cheapest you will find! How much gold do you have?

SELECT gold
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE name = 'Stranger'

Damn! No mon, no fun. There has to be another option to earn gold other than going to work.
Maybe I could collect ownerless items and sell them! Can I make a list of all items that don't belong to anyone?
(Hint: You can recognize ownerless items by: WHERE owner IS NULL)

SELECT *
FROM ITEM
WHERE owner IS NULL

Do you know a trick how to collect all the ownerless items?

UPDATE ITEM
SET owner = 20
WHERE owner IS NULL

Now list all of the items I have!

SELECT *
FROM ITEM
WHERE owner = 20

Find a friendly inhabitant who is either a dealer or a merchant. 
Maybe they want to buy some of my items. 
(Hint: When you use both AND and OR, don't forget to put brackets correctly!)

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE state = 'friendly' AND job = 'dealer' OR job = 'merchant'

Unfortunately, that's not enough gold to buy a sword. Seems like I do have to work after all. 
Maybe it's not a bad idea to change my name from Stranger to my real name before I will apply for a job.

UPDATE INHABITANT
SET name = 'Rama'
WHERE personid = 20

Is there a pilot on this island by any chance? He could fly me home.

SELECT *
FROM INHABITANT
WHERE job = 'pilot'

Find the Chief of Onionville

SELECT inhabitant.name
FROM village, inhabitant
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid AND personid = 13

Hello Rama, the pilot is held captive by Dirty Dieter in his sister's house. 
Shall I tell you how many women there are in Onionville? Nah, you can figure it out by yourself! 
(Hint: Women show up as gender = 'f')

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM inhabitant, village
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid
AND village.name = 'Onionville' AND gender = 'f'

Oh, only one woman. What's her name?

SELECT inhabitant.name 
FROM inhabitant, village
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid
AND village.name = 'Onionville' AND gender = 'f'
